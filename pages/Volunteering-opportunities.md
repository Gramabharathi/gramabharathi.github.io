#### BE AN ONLINE SUPPORTER
<br>
Sometimes even though we feel for a cause and want to be a part of the solution, our day to day work holds us back. At the end of the day we convince ourselves saying ‘I would have done my bit if I had time’.

We believe that if we have the passion for the cause and the spark within, we can make a child smile without disturbing our daily operations. Sign in as a Cyber Advocate for The Grama Bharathi Foundation and all you have to do is:-

- Forward the mailers to your friends and help us spread the word across.

- Promote Grama Bharathi in your social networking profile and ask your friends to follow us.

- Introduce Grama Bharathi to all your online communities/ fan clubs etc.

- Download and use our screensavers, buttons, posters, wallpapers, banners etc.
