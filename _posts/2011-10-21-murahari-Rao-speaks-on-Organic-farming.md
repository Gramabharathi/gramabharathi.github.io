The work that inspired him most is [‘One Straw Revolution’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka) written by [Masanobu Fukuoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka), which probably influenced his interest in agriculture and also made an indelible impression on his thinking towards life.

He lives and encourages younger generation to live a life of joy and prosperity. He cautions us not to get engrossed in western belief system, which pursues profitability resulting in exploitation and egoistic joy.
