## A pioneer in the field of organic agriculture, *Murahari Rao*

### A True Pioneer…

Murahari Rao is a civil engineer from Osmania University and has rendered services as consultant and project head*** for dam construction projects  in few African countries during the initial stages of his career. After a brief international career, he returned to his native village and started organic agriculture.

He lives a simple life, but after talking to him and getting a peak into his thoughts, the actual truth is revealed.

He’s an ardent lover of Mother Nature, greatly appreciates India’s age old traditions, cultural essence and philosophy in which pivotal emphasis is given to nature and environment.

He practices traditional agricultural techniques, which existed in India for thousands of years and which are soil and farmer friendly.

He has practical and viable answers to all those arguments which denigrate organic agriculture and India’s cultural and philosophical hegemony in this regard.

He’s blessed with profound knowledge of plant crops, related diseases, natural techniques for enhancing nutrients and moisture content in soil and which are either found in obscured ancient samskrit texts or any other person who has sustained the knowledge from his ancestors.

He laments at present agricultural techniques, being encouraged by the established agricultural universities. The excessive use of chemical fertilizers that kill the natural life enduring nature of land/soil, that pollutes air, water and even the food produced in these fields.

He mentioned about the [CANCER TRAIN of Punjab](https://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20091001/main7.htm).

### His Philosophy…

The work that inspired him most is ‘One Straw Revolution’ written by Masanobu Fukuoka, which probably influenced his interest in agriculture and also made an indelible impression on his thinking towards life.

He lives and encourages younger generation to live a life of joy and prosperity. He cautions us not to get engrossed in western belief system, which pursues profitability resulting in exploitation and egoistic joy.

He advises Indian way of life, which has elements of saintism and universal acceptance. He says our way of living evolved over thousands of years and was adopted under the aegis of seers and saints, who had dedicated their life for the welfare of the society.

He takes examples of collapsing economical and family institutions in west and on contrary speaks about existence of India and its cultural essence for thousands of years continuously.

He believes in cyclical nature of evolution and states that, irrespective of human initiated activities and conditions in opposition to Mother Nature, the nature will make sure that at some point the younger generation will always return to the roots or to ways of the nature.

Hence he says that natural way of farming or organic agriculture is the destiny and in search of self-reliance and sustenance, the younger generation will defy the trap of multinationals and enslaving governmental policies and realize the truth and take India towards the path of true development.

### Interesting facts….

I would like to mention few details about his home, which are quite unique and interesting.

There is no fan at his home, because it is surrounded by beautiful plants and trees that keep it cool.

They have a small biogas plant, which is the sole source of their cooking needs for years now. They don’t rely on wood or LPG cylinders for cooking.

I’m thankful to my friends, who invited me to join them on this trip and meet such a great personality, because of my innate interest in the fields of social entrepreneurship and agriculture.
